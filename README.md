[Power-Law Correlations in Wrist Actigraphy Data](https://github.com/mark-kaplan-0/Projects/blob/main/Power-Law%20Correlations%20in%20Wrist%20Actigraphy%20Data.pdf)

Abstract of research I performed in a joint Yeshiva University, Bar Ilan University, and Sheba Medical Center summer research internship. We characterized the statistical properties of actigraphy data (a non-invasive method of tracking human rest and activity cycles) to monitor the rehabilitation of TBI and stroke patients.

[Analyzing the Effectiveness of Shifting in Major League Baseball](https://github.com/mark-kaplan-0/Projects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Effectiveness%20of%20Shifting%20in%20Major%20League%20Baseball.ipynb)

Final project for a graduate level Analytical Programming class. We quantitively assessed the effectiveness of a baseball defensive strategy entitled "shifting." We analyzed the effect of the shift on Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) over several seasons, as well as on individual offensive stats during the 2017 season. We used several methods, including visual graphs, statistical comparisons, and machine learning methods.

[Python Mini-Projects](https://github.com/mark-kaplan-0/Projects/tree/main/Python%20Mini-Projects)

A collection of four projects performed throughout an Analytical Programming class.

* [MLB Offensive Production Accross Positions](https://github.com/mark-kaplan-0/Projects/blob/main/Python%20Mini-Projects/MLB%20Offensive%20Production%20Accross%20Positions.ipynb): 
A project to demenostrate skills in Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib & Seaborns. We evaluated how different defensive positions compare with respect to their offensive contribution.

* [Working with HTML, JSON, Web Scraping, and Web APIs](https://github.com/mark-kaplan-0/Projects/blob/main/Python%20Mini-Projects/Working%20with%20HTML%2C%20JSON%2C%20Web%20Scraping%2C%20and%20Web%20APIs.ipynb):
Various tasks to demonstrate web scraping and API skills. 

* [Text Processing, Analyzing Chess Tournament Results](https://github.com/mark-kaplan-0/Projects/blob/main/Python%20Mini-Projects/Text%20Processing%2C%20Analyzing%20Chess%20Tournament%20Results.ipynb):
Demonstrating text processing skills by converting a raw text file of chess tournament results to an organized CSV file containing: Player’s Name, Player’s State, Total Number of Points, Player’s Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Tournament Chess Rating of Opponents

* [Predictive Analysis using scikit-learn](https://github.com/mark-kaplan-0/Projects/blob/main/Python%20Mini-Projects/Predictive%20Analysis%20using%20scikit-learn.ipynb):
The goal of this project was to prepare data for predictive analysis and then construct a predictive model. The research question pursued was: Which attribute (i.e., aside from the poisonous/edible indicator) or attributes are the best predictors of whether a particular mushroom is poisonous or edible?
